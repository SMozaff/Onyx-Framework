# ONYX Cloudflare Worker migration

This directory is now the start of the ONYX backend migration to Cloudflare's free Workers platform. It no longer proxies requests to Render or any other Axum/container origin.

The target architecture is:

```text
Mobile / Admin / Staff
        |
        v
Cloudflare Worker (free workers.dev)
        |
        +---- D1 (free SQLite-compatible database)
        |
        +---- Supabase Auth (Google for All-Father; email/password for Admin/Staff)
        |
        +---- Hugging Face object storage for existing blob data
```

Cloudflare Workers Free is the runtime boundary. No custom domain is required: the `workers.dev` hostname is sufficient. The migration deliberately does not use Cloudflare Containers, Workers Paid, Render, or another paid/container-only service.

## Current state

Phase 1 has converted the Worker from an origin proxy into an origin-free application boundary:

- `/health` is implemented locally in the Worker.
- `/ready` checks the D1 binding when it is configured.
- There is no `ONYX_ORIGIN_URL` and no upstream `fetch()` to Render.
- D1 migrations create the Worker’s authoritative users, organization, event, and audit tables; Supabase Auth stores credentials and authenticates identities.
- Unported ONYX API routes return `501 API_MIGRATION_IN_PROGRESS` rather than silently routing traffic to the unreachable legacy backend.

This is intentional. The Worker is not claimed to be a complete replacement until each API contract has been ported and verified.

## Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare-edge.yml` creates or reuses the free D1 database, applies checked-in migrations, configures Worker secrets, deploys the Worker, and checks `/health`, `/ready`, and anonymous access to a protected route. It requires Cloudflare and Supabase credentials configured as GitHub Actions secrets. The workflow is manually dispatchable; deployment credentials are never committed to the repository.

For local development after authenticating Wrangler:

```bash
npm install
npm run d1:local
npm run dev
```

Do not copy production secrets into `.dev.vars` or commit them.

## Migration rule

The Rust/Axum API remains the reference implementation while individual contracts are ported. We do not rewrite the whole service blindly. For every route, the migration must preserve:

1. request and response JSON contracts;
2. authentication and capability checks;
3. tenant/organization isolation;
4. idempotency and audit semantics where applicable;
5. existing D1-compatible persistence behavior;
6. client compatibility for Mobile, Admin, and Staff shells;
7. automated tests before the route is switched from `501` to live behavior.

Only after all required routes are live and verified will the legacy Render deployment/configuration be removed.
